# MVP

A minimum viable product (MVP) is a version of a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future product development.

We had 2 weeks to developp an MVP of our solution. 

# How to install and start

```
cd hglovesMvp
npm i && npm start 
```

# HGloves

## What is our solution ?

The HGloves project is materialized by a glove, worn by a person with deafblindness. Our gloves are able to retranscribe the alphabet of Lorm in "oral" version through a speaker, as does the Google Home for example. The opposite is also possible, to allow the user to understand what a person said using a microphone and finally giving access to the ease of communication that all do not want to eliminate.
Our solution offers something innovative and offers the user a two-way communication. And that with anyone.
